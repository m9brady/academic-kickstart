abstract: "As Arctic sea ice extent continues to decline, remote sensing observations are becoming even more vital for the monitoring and understanding of sea ice. Recently, the sea ice community has entered a new era of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites operating at C-band with the launch of Sentinel-1A in 2014, Sentinel-1B in 2016 and the RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) in 2019. These missions represent 5 spaceborne SAR sensors, that together routinely cover the pan-Arctic sea ice domain. Here, we utilized over 60,000 SAR images from Sentinel-1AB (S1) and RCM to generate large-scale sea ice motion (SIM) estimates over the pan-Arctic domain from March to December, 2020. On average, 4.5 million SIM vectors from S1 and RCM were automatically detected per week for 2020 and when combined (S1+RCM) they facilitated the generation of 7-day, 25 km SIM products across the pan-Arctic domain. S1+RCM SIM provided more coverage in Hudson Bay, Davis Strait, Beaufort Sea, Bering Sea, and over the North Pole compared to SIM from S1 alone. S1+RCM SIM was able to be resolved within the narrow channels and inlets across the pan-Arctic alleviating the main limitation of coarser resolution sensors. S1+RCM SIM provided larger ice speeds with a mean difference (MD) of 1.3 km/day compared to the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) SIM product and a MD of 0.76 km/day compared to Ocean and Sea Ice-Satellite Application Facility (OSI-SAF) SIM product. S1+RCM was also able to better resolve SIM in the marginal ice zone compared to the NSIDC and OSA-SAF SIM products. Overall, our results demonstrate that combining SIM from multiple spaceborne SAR satellites allows for large-scale SIM to be routinely generated across the pan-Arctic domain."
